# Static-Route
A simple static routing topology built in PnetLab. The project demonstrates how to configure and test static routes between multiple routers, switches, and end devices.
# Static Routing Topology ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a **static routing configuration** using Cisco routers, switches, and PCs.  
The network topology was built in **Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3**, and static routes were used to ensure connectivity between all devices.


âœ… Testing

After configuration, connectivity was verified using ping between all PCs (VPC3, VPC4, VPC).
Each host can successfully reach the others across different subnets via static routes.
